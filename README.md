# mini-social-network

A network where people of similar interests can connect which is created using MERN stack.

Which is inspired by an app called dev-connector ,created by traversy

The objectives of building this application are as follows:

To learn how thingd fit together in a certain app
To learn how front end and back end work together
To learn how to debug various errors and solve them based on best parctices
To learn how to deal with common javascript errors and get to know how to solve them in a  better way and in an efficient way

The whole pont of building this application is get to know about how things work in terms of front end and back end and getting to know how there are different things and where they actuallt fit in.

Javascript helps us to build things on both front end and backend , the best part of learning javascript is that we can use the same language on both sides of the stack

The front of this app consists of a framework called react which is a component based framework which was developed at facebook and been around for a while now

The fllowing section of this course deals with the backend technologies of the app we are building out
